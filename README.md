# SidNeth
TODO: make this readme gud.

This is a mod project I'm working on which adds **sid**egrades to **neth**erite. Currently,there are 2 alternatives to netherite:

### Skystone:

Skystone has a helmet, leggings and boots (TODO: make the defence max out instead of being partially empty). It is based around flying movement with the elytra, and the end. Each piece gives you an extra boost on elytra activation.
#### Set bonus:
If you are sneaking while wearing full skystone (including elytra), you will get the equivalent to slow falling (although without the actual potion effect)
#### Piece bonuses:
- Leggings divide kinetic energy damage by 4
- Boots cancel fall damage entirely
- Helmet acts like a pumpkin for endermen (No overlay, though)

### Aquanite:

Aquanite is a full water based set. It *really* needs extra bonuses, it's comparatively weak. Each piece makes you faster in water.
#### Set bonus:
None currently. Needs to be done.
#### Piece bonuses:
- Helmet lets you breathe in water

### Netherite:

Yes, this is normal netherite. It's a nether themed set, obviously. It also has extra powers on top of the knockback resistance that's vanilla.

#### Set bonus:
Become fully fire immune. You can't even be set on fire, and you immediately extinguish upon equipping full netherite. Piglins also become peaceful, as if you were wearing gold.
####Piece bonuses:
- Leggings and boots (both required) let you swim in lava as if it were water.
- Helmet lets you see better in lava

## Required before a 1.0.0 release:
- Textures for everything
- Recipes for everything
- Ores for everything
- Buff aquanite
- Modmenu integration, config for all sets and properties
